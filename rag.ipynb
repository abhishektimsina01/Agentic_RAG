Instead of performing a single attention function, multi-head attention is used. Self-attention is a layer where the weight assigned to each value is computed by a compatibility function of the query with the corresponding key. Multi-head attention works by allowing the model to jointly attend to information from different representation subspaces at different positions. The use of multi-head attention allows the heads to learn different tasks, including those related to the syntactic and semantic structure of sentences. The operations of self-attention have different complexities, and the use of multi-head attention can help in reducing the complexity.',\n",

Instead of performing a single attention function, multi-head attention is used. Self-attention is a layer where the weight assigned to each value is computed by a compatibility function of the query with the corresponding key. Multi-head attention works by allowing the model to jointly attend to information from different representation subspaces at different positions. The use of multi-head attention allows the heads to learn different tasks, including those related to the syntactic and semantic structure of sentences. The operations of self-attention have different complexities, and the use of multi-head attention can help in reducing the complexity.',\n",
